Vacation Tracking System (VTS)

Vision:
The goal of the system is to provide an intuitive platform for managing vacation, sick leave, and personal time off. This minimizes HR involvement, empowers employees to manage leave independently, and reduces the workload on managers and HR personnel.

Manage Time Use Case Flow
Main Flow:
1.	The employee logs into the Vacation Tracking System (VTS) through the company portal.
2.	The VTS displays the employee's current vacation balance and previous leave requests.
3.	The employee chooses to create a new vacation request.
4.	The employee selects the type of leave (e.g., vacation, sick leave) and sets the dates.
5.	The employee enters necessary details (e.g., start date, end date, description).
6.	The employee submits the request for approval.
7.	If there are errors (e.g., insufficient balance, invalid dates), the system prompts corrections.
8.	If the request is valid, it’s submitted for managerial approval, and the status is set to “Pending.”
9.	The system sends an email to the manager notifying them of the request.
10.	The manager reviews the request and either approves or rejects it via an email link.
Alternative Flows:
•	Withdraw Request: The employee removes a pending request, and the system notifies the manager.
•	Cancel Approved Request: The employee cancels an approved request, restoring the balance and notifying the manager.
•	Edit Pending Request: The employee updates the request details (e.g., new dates), and the system validates the changes.

Technical Design Considerations
1.	API Integration:
o	Interfaces with existing HR systems to retrieve and update leave balances.
o	Supports legacy systems for seamless data transfer.
2.	Database Structure:
o	Tables for employee data, vacation types, requests, balances, and status tracking.
o	Key relationships between tables for efficient data management (e.g., employee leaves, request status).
3.	Pseudocode Example:
o	SaveRequest: Validates the leave request, saves it in the database, and notifies the manager asynchronously.
o	ValidateRequest: Ensures the request date is valid and the employee has sufficient balance for the requested leave.
4.	Design Approaches:
o	Bottom-up: Focuses on defining entities first, providing flexibility for changes but possibly lacking an overall view.
o	Top-down: Starts with high-level database design, offering a more structured approach but requiring more effort to implement changes.

Future Enhancements
•	Add new leave statuses (e.g., HR Pending, HR Approved) with minimal system changes.
•	Expand features to support additional leave categories or integration with third-party tools.
